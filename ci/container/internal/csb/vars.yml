# We skip check updates because trivy tries pulling an image from GHCR but
# often gets rate limited. Trivy has config databases built into the binary
# and we update it fairly often, whenever we rebuild general-task. Especially
# since we do not depend on the vulnerability scanning, only the misconfig
# checks, that is often enough.
